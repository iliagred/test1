# Potential areas of improvement
##### 1. Infra
Extend template to have at least one separate agent

##### 2. Jenkins plugins
Find way to install just needed plugins before the actual jenkins run

##### 3. Closer to real life
Transform 'echo' statements to some real life stuff (consider time to
complete the execution), e.g. add some tests and run them depending
to the branch
